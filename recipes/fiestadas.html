        <h2>How to Make Hearty Lasagna</h2>
        <ol><li><strong>Start by making the sauce,</strong> season your ground beef with salt, pepper, onion, and garlic powder. Brown your seasoned meat in a pot and drain the grease. After the grease is drained, add in your zesty packet to the beef and add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil. While the meat and sauce mixture is heating up, put tomato paste in a sauce pan with olive oil and heat until the paste is brick red.
        Once the tomato juice and meat comes to a boil, add the tomato paste and stir in. Put the lid on and let the sauce simmer. </li>
            <li><strong>Next, cook your noodles.</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in a pot of water 8 to 10 minutes until al dente. Drain the water and set the noodles aside to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Make your cheese mixture.</strong>Mix the ricotta and feta together and add the italian seasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna!</strong>In your baking dish, start with a layer of sauce, noodles, and the feta and ricotta mixture. Keep layering the sauce, noodles, and Italian blend/mozzarella cheese until you're to the top of the baking dish. Top with the extra shredded cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Time to bake!</strong>Cover with tinfoil, and put in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Then remove the tinfoil and bake for 5 to 10 minutes until cheese is bubbling and brown.</li>
        </ol>
